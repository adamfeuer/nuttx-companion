`NuttX <https://nuttx.incubator.apache.org/>`_ is a very capable, small, fast, POSIX-compatible, internet-connected real-time operating system.

This book is meant to be a companion to the `NuttX Documentation <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTTX/Nuttx>`_. Hopefully it will provide
some more help for people interested in learning about NuttX, getting it running on their embedded hardware, and developing applications on it.
