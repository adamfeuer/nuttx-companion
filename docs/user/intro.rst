Introduction
============

This is the NuttX Companion, a warm and friendly guide to all things NuttX– how to install it,
configure it, develop on it, debug it, improve it, get help from its community, and generally 
be happy and have fun with a very fast, small, capable, POSIX-compatible, internet-connected real-time 
operating system.

Hopefully this guide will complement the NuttX documentation, filling in gaps when needed, and 
providing a way for people to get started with NuttX easily.

If you have improvements, corrections, additions, or things you'd like to see covered here,
let me know!
